#Python CHIP-8 CPU Interpreter

Description:
-------------
A Python based GUI implementation of the CHIP-8 system. A project I developed with the intention of gaining knowledge about emulators and cross platform GUI libraries.
For more specific information about the CHIP-8 system, please refer to the following WIKI article on [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8).

Supports:
-------------
- Microsoft Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10
- Linux Based Distributions

ROMs:
-------------
ROMs for the CHIP-8 system can be downloaded for free at [Chip8.com](http://www.chip8.com/?page=84) and [Zophar's Domain](http://www.zophar.net/pdroms/chip8.html). In order to load these ROMs with the emulator, the files must be renamed to have a `.c8` extension.

Dependencies:
-------------
- `Python 3` [(Build 3.4)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- `PyQt 4` [(Build 4.11)](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download)
